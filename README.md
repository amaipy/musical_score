# musical_score
An interactive virtual canvas that acts as a musical score. It was created as an assignment for the "Reviews and Production for the Web" course at UFMG in the second term of 2019 (02/2019).
The instruments are flowers, clouds, moons, stars and butterflies, each one sounding in a specific way. Note range may vary from B3 to F5.

The foward button accelerates and backward button decelerates play speed. The play button needs to be pressed to hear sounds. Note pitch may vary depending on the instrument's size (as you may enlarge by holding it when putting it on the canvas).

The color palette can be changed by selecting one of the existents in the lower buttons section.

You can save a screenshot of the canvas by selecting the camera button.

If you want to reset the canvas, just press the reload button above the camera button.
